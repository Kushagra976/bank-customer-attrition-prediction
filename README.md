# Bank Customer Attrition Prediction

This project predicts whether a bank customer will churn using Logistic Regression and GridSearchCV.

## Objective
Build a binary classification model to identify customers likely to leave the bank.

## Techniques Used
- Data preprocessing
- Feature encoding
- StandardScaler
- Logistic Regression
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Model evaluation (Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC)

## Dataset
Bank Customer Attrition Dataset (Kaggle)
